# setup_xspec

# Requirements for Mac
* gcc - Best to install via homebrew with "brew install gcc"

* wget - Install via homebrew: "brew install wget"

# Special Note on Clang
While the XCode C compiler, Clang, was the standard compiler to use for XSPEC,
this is no longer the case and is no longer compatible.
